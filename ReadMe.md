# üëã i'm Sam, i Write & Build Stuff...

"in search of a better understanding of the world..."

As Oscar Wilde said, "*To define is to limit*." Nevertheless, here we go... i've been learning to program for *~6* years now (As of the year 12025 .) i started off with installing Ubuntu 18.04 LTS on my ancient PC running on the legendary **Core 2 Duo** with 4GB of DDR3 Dual Channel memory, which was having a hard time with Windows 10. i tried various OSes since then. i went through Windows 7, 8, and now, 11. i did some experimenting with *Custom Android ROMs*. i explored other Ubuntu-based distros, Debian, Fedora, and Arch families, Security-focused, Server-focused, and many other distributions. it's a mess .) After a while, **Ubuntu** just felt like that sweet spot, and it gave me a sense of home. And nowadays, i run a *dual-boot* system with Windows 11 & Ubuntu 24.04 LTS

  i started learning more and more, as life went on and on, and here i am. What began as a side quest became a hobby, then grew into a passion: Linux Distros, BA$H, Python 3, AI/ML Basics, Computational Systems, Networks, Cybersecurity, Game Development with Unreal Engine & C++, and then, JavaScript, Node.js, React.js, Next.js, TypeScript... and life goes on. Nowadays, i build web applications with Next.js

  i love music, i love stories, i love physics, and i am eternally curious about the nature of things. i like uncovering obscure patterns that govern our existence, as you know it. Along the way, my journey became a story of its own, so i started to write things down, and now i love writing more than anything. Writing gives me clarity...

"As artists,  
we reach for something.  
We try to create something  
more than ourselves.  
Something bigger than ourselves.  
Creations are symbiotic in nature;  
We shape it as much as it shapes us.  
We do not hold it ‚Äî  
it holds us..."

P.S. Yes, the choice of using `i` instead of `I` is intentional. And yes, i like the `Holocene calendar` format.)
