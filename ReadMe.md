# üëã i'm Sam, i Write & Build Stuff.

&nbsp;

As Oscar Wilde said, "*To define is to limit*." Nevertheless, here we go... i've been learning to program for *~6* years now (As of 12025 .) i started off by installing Ubuntu 20.04 LTS on my ancient PC, which was having a hard time with Windows 10. i tried various OSes since then. i tried Windows 7, 8, and now, 11. i also tried many other Linux distros, and Ubuntu just felt like that sweet spot. i started learning more and more, as life went on and on, and here i am. What began as a side hustle turned into a hobby, which then turned into a kind of passion: Linux Distros, BA$H, Python, JavaScript, Node, React, Next.js, TypeScript, and life goes on. i love music, i love stories, and i am eternally curious about the nature of things. i like uncovering obscure patterns that govern our existence, as you know it. Along the way, my journey became a story of its own, so i started to write things down, and now i love writing more than anything.

"As artists,  
We always try to create  
something more than ourselves,  
something bigger than ourselves.  

Creations are symbiotic in nature.  
We shape it as much as it shapes us.  
We do not hold it ‚Äî  
it holds us. "
